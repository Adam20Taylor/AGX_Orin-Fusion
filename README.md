# AGX_Orin-Fusion
RGB-D and LiDAR fusion deployed on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin and utilizing the data from a ROBOTNIK-VOGUI robot platform.
The code has been tested using the following environment:
- JetPack 5.12
- Python 3.8
- PyTorch 2.1.0
- CUDA 11.7
- MMCV 1.7.0

The pretrained weights and config files for the baseline models can be found at: [weights](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d).
Our trained weights used for the mid fusion can be found here: [weights](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jRB-KSJ0AMDmxnrNR4nubV6aQ3nwdZrb?usp=sharing)
